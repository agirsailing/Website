                Welcome to our new team from KTH, Ägir Sailing Team! We are a totally new student 
                team that started at the beginning of December. We have already structured 
                ourselves and have started developing our design for the competition. Our team 
                structure consists of a board and four different departments. The departments are 
                Communication, Marketing & Management, Design & Manufacturing, and Quality 
                Assurance. The board consists of the Captain and Co-captain, Linnea and Matteo, 
                and the department managers, Baptiste (Marketing&Management), Linn and Sebastian 
                (Design&Manufacturing), Oscar (Quality Assurance), and Viktor (Communication). 
                All people besides Viktor are doing their masters in Aerospace or Naval 
                Architecture. Viktor is in his bachelor in vehicle engineering and is the 
                communication officer for the team. Besides the board, there are 20+ people that 
                work in different subgroups under the four departments. Every Monday we all get 
                together and discuss what we have achieved and our plans for the coming week, so 
                that everyone knows how our overall situation is and our path forward.

                Our team started with one project course in mind, Naval Design. This is a course 
                at KTH given to master students in Naval Architecture and Aerospace students. 
                The SuMoth challenge checks many of the boxes that the course has, so when the 
                course examiner, Ulysse, heard of it it was a no-brainer. But more help was needed,
                 so they opened up for everyone at KTH to join. With this, some new faces showed up.
                We now also have bachelor students on our project. Some of them are doing their 
                thesis on the project, but we also have people doing it in their free time. With 
                a lot of us doing it as a part of our education and getting credit for our time 
                spent on the project, we hope to get a lot of things done, even though we 
                started quite late. Those doing the naval design course are spending at a
                minimum 12 hours weekly on the project, and those doing their bachelor thesis 
                have at least 16 hours a week designated for it. In addition to the designated
                time, most people spend multiple extra hours per week, all to make sure the 
                team has a boat at Garda.

                Our plans are to go all the way to Lake Garda (S3) with a boat. To accomplish this,
                we have an internal deadline to have our first prototype in the water by at the 
                latest in the latter part of April. We hope and believe this will give us 
                sufficient time to find and repair all the problems that come up under our testing 
                phase. At the moment we are on track for this to happen and already have a mast and
                a boom. We also have started some material testing, and are still talking to a lot
                of different companies about potentially sponsoring us with either materials and/
                or funding. But there is a lot of time left for things to go wrong, so we hope and 
                will do our best to keep to our deadline. And if time tells us we don't have enough 
                time to repair everything, we will still do all our best to be on the best foot 
                come season 2027. We already have people involved who will be in the team for the 
                next season to make sure as little information and company contacts get lost. But 
                we will nonetheless be in Garda to watch, learn and socialise, with or without a 
                boat.
